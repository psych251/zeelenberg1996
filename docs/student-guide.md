# Student guide: from template to live experiment

This is the human path from an empty repository to a live web experiment
with your data in hand. Every step also has a skill in `.claude/skills/`
that an AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and so on) can
follow for you: open the repo in the agent and ask it to "set up
Firebase for this experiment" or "deploy this to GitHub Pages". The
account steps, where you click around in a website while signed in, are
always yours to do.

Written for a first-year who has not done web development. Where a step
introduces a term, the term is defined the first time it appears; there
is also a glossary at the end.

## What you need before you start

|  |  |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **A GitHub account**, added to the class organization | Ask the course staff if you are not in it yet. |
| **A personal Google account** | *Not* your Stanford account. See "Why a personal Google account?" in section 2. |
| **Node.js 18 or newer** | The program that runs the template's tools. Check with `node --version`. Install from <https://nodejs.org> (the "LTS" download). |
| **Git** | Check with `git --version`. macOS installs it when you first run the command. |
| **Java 17 or newer** | **Required**, not optional: `npm test` runs a local copy of the database to check your experiment, and that copy is a Java program. Get it from <https://adoptium.net>, or on a Mac `brew install --cask temurin`. Do not follow the "install Java" link macOS pops up: it offers Java 8, which is too old. |
| **R and RStudio** (2022.07 or newer, which includes Quarto), with `tidyverse`, `jsonlite`, `knitr` and `rmarkdown` | For the replication report, which also runs your analysis. RStudio offers to install missing packages the first time you open the report; say yes. |
| **A laptop or desktop** | You do not need a phone. The demo deliberately refuses to run on one, because its word task needs a keyboard. |

You do **not** need a credit card at any point. Everything here is free.

Three terms used throughout:

-   **Agent**: an AI coding assistant working inside your repository,
    such as Claude Code.
-   **Skill**: a file in `.claude/skills/` telling the agent how to do
    one of these jobs. You never write these; they are already in the
    template.
-   **Firestore emulator**: a local practice copy of the Firebase
    database that runs on your own machine, so tests never touch your
    real data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Create your repo from the template

1.  On the template's GitHub page click **Use this template → Create a
    new repository**. Owner: the class organization. Name: your project
    shortcite, e.g. `smith2016`. Visibility: **Public**. GitHub Pages,
    which puts your experiment online for free, needs a public
    repository on a free plan.

2.  **Clone** it, which means downloading your own copy to work on. On
    your new repository's page click the green **Code** button, choose
    the **HTTPS** tab, and copy the URL. Then in a terminal, in whatever
    folder you keep projects in:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/psych251/smith2016.git
    cd smith2016
    npm install
    ```

    `npm install` downloads the tools the template uses. It takes a
    couple of minutes and prints a lot; warnings are fine, errors are
    not.

3.  Start the experiment on your own machine and open
    <http://localhost:8000>:

    ``` bash
    npm start
    ```

    You will see a red banner reading "Data is NOT being saved …
    placeholder values". That is correct for now: you have not connected
    a database yet. Click through the whole demo; at the end you get a
    **Download data (JSON)** button instead of saving. Press `Ctrl+C` in
    the terminal to stop the server.

    You can also open `index.html` by double-clicking it, and the demo
    will appear to work. Don't: once you connect your database in
    section 2, saving behaves differently when the page is opened as a
    file rather than served, and stimulus files can fail to load. Always
    use `npm start`.

4.  Check the automated test, in a second terminal (or after stopping
    the server):

    ``` bash
    npm test
    ```

    A robot participant plays the whole experiment against the local
    practice database and checks that the data arrives. The first run
    downloads two things, the database emulator (about 140 MB) and a
    test browser (about 150 MB), so it takes a few minutes; later runs
    take about a minute. It should end with **10 passed** before you
    change anything.

    Run `npm test` again after every change you make, and always before
    you push.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Create your Firebase project

Firebase is Google's free database service; your experiment writes each
participant's data straight into a **project** that belongs to you.
Budget about half an hour the first time. All screens below were
confirmed on a brand-new personal Google account in September 2026.
Google redesigns this console often, so if a screen does not match, look
for the same words rather than the same layout.

### Why a personal Google account?

University Google Workspace accounts usually block creating Firebase
projects. With a Stanford account, the Firebase console greys out
**Continue** and offers a "Select parent resource" button with nothing
selectable; the Google Cloud console says *"You must select a parent
organization or folder"* and lists only "No organization", which cannot
be chosen. That is university policy, not a broken page: switch to a
personal account. A personal account also means the project, and your
data, stay with you after the course.

### 2.1 Create the project

1.  Go to <https://console.firebase.google.com> signed in with your
    **personal** Google account.
2.  On a brand-new account you land on a welcome page ("Hello, \<name\>
    — Welcome to Firebase!"). Click the large card **Get started by
    setting up a Firebase project**. On an account that already has
    projects this is a **Create a project** button instead.
3.  **Name screen.** Type a project name, e.g. `smith2016-replication`.
    A **project id** like `smith2016-replication-a1b2c` is generated
    underneath; that id is the name Google uses internally. Leave it
    alone.
    -   Leave **I accept the Firebase terms** ticked.
    -   Turn **off** "Join the Google Developer Program" (on by default;
        not needed).
    -   Click **Continue**.
4.  **AI assistance screen.** Turn **off** "Enable Gemini in Firebase"
    (on by default and labelled Recommended; not needed). Click
    **Continue**.
5.  **Google Analytics screen.** Turn **off** "Enable Google Analytics
    for this project" (on by default). Click **Continue**. If you leave
    it on, an extra screen asks you to pick an Analytics account, which
    you do not want.
6.  Wait for "Your Firebase project is ready", then **Continue** to the
    project overview.
7.  You are on the free **Spark** plan by default, shown as a badge next
    to the project name. Never upgrade to Blaze for this course. Ignore
    the "Next steps with Gemini" cards.

### 2.2 Create the database

1.  In the left sidebar click **Databases & Storage**; a flyout opens.
    Under **NoSQL** click **Firestore**. Do not click "Realtime
    Database", a different product listed just below it.
2.  Click **Create database**, ignoring the "Ask Gemini" banner. The
    wizard has three steps.
3.  **Select edition.** Leave **Standard edition** selected and click
    **Next**. Do not pick Enterprise.
4.  **Database ID & location.** Leave the Database ID as **(default)**.
    Pick a location near you, e.g. `us-west1 (Oregon)`. This cannot be
    changed later. Click **Next**.
5.  **Configure.** Leave **Start in production mode** selected. The
    preview shows `allow read, write: if false;`, meaning nothing may
    read or write yet; you fix that in the next step. Do **not** choose
    test mode: it opens your database to everyone and stops working
    after 30 days, which lands in the middle of data collection. Click
    **Create**.
6.  You land on the **Data** tab. Click the **Rules** tab and check it
    shows the deny-all rules.

### 2.3 Publish the security rules

**Rules** are the file that decides who may read and write your data.
The template ships the right ones; you just publish them.

1.  On the **Rules** tab, select everything in the editor and delete it.
2.  Open `firebase/firestore.rules` from your repo, copy the whole file,
    paste it in, and click **Publish**. The history panel on the left
    shows a new entry with today's time.

These rules let a participant add their own data and nothing else. In
particular nobody can read your data from a browser, which is why you
export it with a script in section 6. Never replace them with
`allow read, write: if true` to make something work; if writes are
failing, the troubleshooting table at the end of this guide has the real
cause.

### 2.4 Enable anonymous sign-in

Each participant is signed in **anonymously**: Firebase gives their
browser a random id with no account, no email and no password, so the
rules can tell one participant from another without collecting anything
identifying.

1.  In the left sidebar click **Security**, then **Authentication** in
    the flyout.
2.  Click **Get started**. On the **Sign-in method** tab click
    **Anonymous**.
3.  The panel has **two** things labelled Enable. Turn on the **toggle**
    next to "Anonymous" at the top right. Leave the **"Enable Auto
    clean-up"** checkbox unticked. Click **Save**.
4.  Anonymous should now show as **Enabled** in the provider list.

If you skip this step, every write fails and the experiment shows its
red banner.

### 2.5 Register a web app and fill in `firebase-config.js`

The **config object** is six lines telling your page which Firebase
project to talk to.

1.  Click the gear next to **Project Overview** → **Project settings** →
    **General** tab. Scroll to **Your apps** and click the web icon
    **`</>`**.

2.  Nickname: anything. Leave **Firebase Hosting** unticked. Click
    **Register app**.

3.  On the "Add Firebase SDK" step choose **Config**, not npm and not
    CDN. You get a bare object beginning `const firebaseConfig = {`.
    Copy the six lines **inside** the braces.

4.  Open `firebase-config.js`. It is at the top level of the folder you
    cloned in section 1, next to `index.html`; open it in any text
    editor. Below a block of comments it reads:

    ``` js
    window.FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
      apiKey: "PASTE_ME",
      authDomain: "PASTE_ME.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "PASTE_ME",
      storageBucket: "PASTE_ME.firebasestorage.app",
      messagingSenderId: "PASTE_ME",
      appId: "PASTE_ME",
    };
    ```

    Replace the six `PASTE_ME` lines with the six lines you copied.
    **Keep the first line as `window.FIREBASE_CONFIG = {`.** If you
    paste the console's whole block over the whole block, the first line
    becomes `const firebaseConfig = {`, the page silently fails to find
    your settings, and you stay in offline mode with no error explaining
    why. Leave the comments above it untouched. Save.

5.  Check your work: `grep '"PASTE_ME' firebase-config.js` should print
    nothing, and `npm test` should still pass. (Match the quote as
    shown: a plain `grep PASTE_ME` also finds the word in the comments
    above, which stay there on purpose.)

6.  Commit and push:

    ``` bash
    git add firebase-config.js
    git commit -m "Add Firebase config"
    git push
    ```

    Yes, this file goes into a public repository on purpose. The config
    is an address, not a password: every participant's browser downloads
    it anyway. The rules you published in 2.3 are what protect your
    data.

### 2.6 Check that data arrives

1.  `npm start`, then reload <http://localhost:8000>. The red banner
    should be gone.
2.  Run through the whole demo to "All done".
3.  In the console sidebar go to **Project shortcuts → Firestore →
    Data** and click through `experiments` → `framing-demo` →
    `participants` → the one document. It should show `completed: true`,
    a `condition`, and a `trials` subcollection holding one document per
    trial.

Every page load counts as a new participant, so testing repeatedly is
fine: each run gets its own record and never overwrites the last one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Put it online with GitHub Pages

1.  Push everything, then on GitHub go to **Settings → Pages → Build and
    deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch: `main`, folder:
    `/ (root)` → Save**.
2.  After a minute or two your experiment is live at
    `https://psych251.github.io/smith2016/`. Open it, run through it
    once, and confirm a new participant appears in Firestore.
3.  Every `git push` to `main` republishes within a minute or two. If
    you see an old version, hard-reload the page (`Cmd+Shift+R` /
    `Ctrl+Shift+R`).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Build your experiment

Edit `experiment.js`. The demo shows every piece you are likely to need:
consent, instructions, a survey page, a between-subjects manipulation
with random assignment, a keyboard reaction-time block, Likert and
free-text feedback, and a debrief. jsPsych's own documentation is at
<https://www.jspsych.org/latest/>. Three rules:

-   **Consent stays first and the debrief stays last.** The consent
    wording is the course-wide approved text; change only the contact
    email. The welcome, task instructions and debrief text should all be
    rewritten for your study.
-   **Keep `npm test` green.** When you change the flow, update
    `runThroughExperiment` in `tests/experiment.spec.js` so the robot
    still knows what to click. That test is your guarantee that the
    study still runs and still saves before you send it to real people.
-   **Ask the agent.** "Replace the demo with \<your task\>" is exactly
    what the `web-experiment` skill is for.

Settings at the top of `experiment.js`:

| Setting | What to do with it |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `id` | The name of the collection your data lands in. Change it when you move between phases (`smith2016-pilot-a`, `smith2016-pilot-b`, `smith2016-final`) so datasets never mix. |
| `chunk_size` | How many trials are saved per write. 1 saves every trial as it happens. For long reaction-time studies raise it to about 20 to stay inside the free daily limit. Expected writes per participant are roughly trials ÷ `chunk_size` + 3; the free tier allows 20,000 a day. |
| `prolific_completion_code` | From your Prolific study page; see section 5. |
| `requires_keyboard` | Leave `true` if any part of your study is answered with keys. Phones and tablets are then turned away before consent, because they have no keyboard and would otherwise produce sessions that look complete but contain nothing. Set it to `false` only if your study is entirely buttons and typing. |

To add a jsPsych plugin, add it to `package.json` and
`scripts/vendor.js`, run `npm install && npm run vendor`, and add the
`<script>` tag to `index.html`. Do not link to plugins on the internet;
the template keeps its own pinned copies in `lib/` so your experiment
cannot change under you mid-study.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Recruit

**Prolific.** Your study URL is your Pages URL with some extra
information on the end:

```         
https://psych251.github.io/smith2016/?PROLIFIC_PID={{%PROLIFIC_PID%}}&STUDY_ID={{%STUDY_ID%}}&SESSION_ID={{%SESSION_ID%}}
```

Everything after the `?` is how Prolific tells your page who is taking
part; each `name=value` pair is a **query parameter**. Paste the line
exactly as written: the `{{%…%}}` parts are Prolific's own placeholders
and Prolific substitutes the real values when it sends someone to you.
Do not type anything in their place. The template stores all three ids
with the participant's data.

Put your **completion code** (from the Prolific study page) into
`prolific_completion_code` in `experiment.js`, and choose "I'll redirect
them using a URL" as the completion method. Once a code is set, a real
participant is sent back to Prolific automatically at the end instead of
seeing the "All done" screen. Test runs (`npm test` and anything with
`?emulator=1`) deliberately stay on the page, so setting your code
cannot break your tests.

Check the whole thing with Prolific's **Preview** link before publishing
the study.

If saving fails for a participant, they do **not** get redirected: they
see the completion code together with a request to download their data
and email it to you. That is deliberate, since they did the work and
should be paid, but it means a Prolific submission is not by itself
proof that you have their data. Before approving a batch, compare the
number of completed rows in your export with the number of submissions,
and check your inbox for rescued files.

**Pilot A and Pilot B.** Use a different `EXPERIMENT.id` for each phase,
and run the course's pilot checklists as usual.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Get your data out

Nobody can read your data from a browser, by design. You read it with a
script that authenticates as the project owner using a **service-account
key**: a file that proves the script is you. It is the one real secret
in this whole setup.

1.  In the **Firebase** console (not GitHub) click the gear next to
    **Project Overview** → **Project settings** → **Service accounts**
    tab. The panel has a Node.js / Java / Python / Go selector that only
    changes the sample code shown; ignore it. Click **Generate new
    private key**, then **Generate key**. A `.json` file downloads.

2.  Move that file **outside** your repository, for example to
    `~/keys/`. Never commit it, never paste its contents anywhere, never
    send it to anyone. Anyone holding it can read and delete everything
    in your project. If it ever reaches GitHub, delete the key in the
    Google Cloud console immediately and generate a new one. The
    repository ignores the common key filenames as a backstop, but do
    not rely on that: keep it out of the folder entirely.

3.  Export, where `--experiment` is the `id` from the `EXPERIMENT` block
    in `experiment.js` (for the untouched demo that is `framing-demo`):

    ``` bash
    npm run export -- --experiment smith2016-final --key ~/keys/smith2016-abc123.json
    ```

    If it reports finding nothing, the `--experiment` value almost
    certainly does not match your `EXPERIMENT.id`.

    This writes into `data/raw/smith2016-final/`:

    | File | What it holds |
    |------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
    | `participants.csv` | One row per participant: start and end time, whether they finished, condition, browser. |
    | `trials.csv` | One row per trial, **long format** (one row per observation rather than one row per person). Columns holding structured answers are stored as JSON text. |
    | `errors.csv` | JavaScript errors that happened in participants' browsers, with the trial number. Empty is good. |
    | `export.json` | Everything, exactly as stored, for safekeeping. |
    | `identifiers.csv` | Links each participant to their Prolific id. **Gitignored**: use it to approve and pay people, and never commit it. |

    The first four contain no Prolific ids, no URL parameters and no IP
    addresses, so they are safe to commit.

4.  Render your replication report (section 7). Its Results section
    reads these files and runs the analysis, so there is no separate
    analysis file to keep in step with it. Check that `experiment_id` in
    the report's first code chunk matches what you passed to
    `--experiment`.

5.  **Commit your data** so the repository is a complete record. Read
    the free-text columns first and blank anything a participant typed
    that could identify them. Leave `identifiers.csv` where it is.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Write your replication report

Your report is `writeup/replication-report.qmd`, a **Quarto** document:
text and R code in one file, which RStudio turns into a web page. It is
also where your analysis lives: its results sections read the CSVs from
section 6 and compute everything themselves.

The project has two phases, and the report has a part for each:

-   **Phase 1, the replication**, in the standard replication-report
    structure used for every project in the course.
-   **Phase 2, the extension**: a modification of your Phase 1
    experiment, proposed once Phase 1 is done. Follow the Extension
    guidelines page on Canvas.

At the top sit the **AI use statement** and the **Key statistics**
table, which has one row each for the original study, Phase 1 and Phase
2 and fills itself in as each phase is exported.

**Render it** by opening it in RStudio and pressing **Render**
(`Cmd+Shift+K` / `Ctrl+Shift+K`). The output,
`writeup/replication-report.html`, is self-contained, so you can send it
to anyone. It is gitignored: commit the `.qmd` and regenerate the HTML.

You write the report across the whole project, not at the end:

| When | What to write |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Proposal | Fill in the **Project links** box and the **Introduction**, and start the **AI use statement** at the top. |
| Before Pilot A | **Methods**: power analysis, planned sample, materials, procedure, analysis plan, and the **differences from the original** table. Enter the original study's numbers in the code chunk near the top, which the power analysis and the side-by-side figure both use. Edit the Results code to match your design. |
| Pilot A | Render with your pilot data. This is the point of Pilot A: proving your analysis runs on data your experiment actually produces. |
| Preregistration | Register the Introduction and Methods on OSF before final data collection, then add the link to the Project links box. Leave the Methods addendum out of what you register. |
| Phase 1 complete | Phase 1 **Methods addendum** (actual sample, deviations), **Results** (with the side-by-side plot) and **Discussion**. The Phase 1 row of **Key statistics** fills in from your data. |
| Extension proposal | Phase 2 **Rationale**, **Changes from Phase 1**, **Power and sample** and **Analysis plan**, following the Extension guidelines page on Canvas. |
| Phase 2 | Change `EXPERIMENT.id` in `experiment.js` to a new id (for example `smith2016-phase2`), set `experiment_id_phase2` at the top of the report to match, run the study, export it, and write the Phase 2 **Results** and **Discussion**. The Phase 2 row of Key statistics fills in. |
| Throughout | Keep the **AI use statement** current. Finish with the data and code availability statement at the end. |

Some things to know:

-   **Grey "Guidance" boxes are instructions.** Delete each one when you
    have written that section. A box left in your final report means a
    section was not done.
-   **It renders before you have data.** The Results section shows a "No
    data yet" box and skips itself, so you can render and share your
    Methods for feedback from the start.
-   **Show the original next to your replication.** Every report should
    include a figure with the original finding and yours side by side,
    on the same scale. Replot both from the original's reported numbers
    if you can, replot the original from its data if the authors shared
    it, and otherwise place a screenshot of the original figure next to
    your plot. The report's guidance shows how to do each.
-   **Phase 2 changes exactly what you list.** Every change from Phase 1
    goes in the Changes table with a category, and everything else stays
    identical: same materials, wording, procedure, exclusion rule and
    analysis. The report analyses both phases with the same code, so
    they stay comparable. Run Phase 2 under its own experiment id so its
    data never mix with Phase 1's.
-   **The replication judgment is about effect size.** Base your summary
    on how the size of your effect compares with the original's, with
    confidence intervals, not only on whether your key test is
    significant.
-   **You write all of the report's text yourself.** That is course
    policy. AI tools may help with code, and may comment on drafts you
    have written, but may not write, rewrite or paraphrase the text. The
    coding agent in this repository is told the same thing, so asking it
    to draft a section will get you comments rather than text.
-   **The AI use statement is required, and comes first.** List every AI
    tool you used, including coding agents, what each was used for, and
    how you checked what it produced. It sits at the top of the report
    so readers see it before anything else. Fill it in as you go; it is
    much harder to reconstruct at the end.
-   **Do not commit the original paper.** The repository is public and
    most papers cannot be redistributed. Cite it with its DOI in the
    Project links box. If you want a local copy for yourself or your
    agent, put it in an `original_paper/` folder, which is set up never
    to be committed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Devices

The demo requires a physical keyboard, so phones and tablets get a
"Please use a computer" screen before consent, and the visit is recorded
with `device_supported: false` so you can see how many arrived that way.
Without this, a phone participant would sail through, fail to answer
every keyboard trial, and be saved as a complete session containing no
usable data, which is far harder to spot than someone who simply gives
up. The analysis stub also drops participants who never responded to a
single speeded trial. If your study has no keyboard trials, set
`requires_keyboard: false` in `experiment.js`.

## Things that go wrong, and the fix

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Red banner: "placeholder values" | `firebase-config.js` not filled in | Section 2.5 |
| Red banner saying "Enable Anonymous sign-in" (the code reads `admin-restricted-operation` or `operation-not-allowed`) | Anonymous sign-in not enabled | Section 2.4 |
| Red banner saying the database refused the write (`permission-denied`) | Rules never published | Section 2.3 |
| That same banner appearing suddenly, about a month after you created the project, having worked until then | The project was created in test mode and those rules have now expired | Paste `firebase/firestore.rules` on the Rules tab and Publish (section 2.3) |
| Banner is gone but data still does not appear | You pasted over `window.FIREBASE_CONFIG = {` and renamed it | Section 2.5, step 4 |
| `npm test` fails: "Executable doesn't exist" | Test browser not downloaded | `npx playwright install chromium`, then `npm test` |
| `npm test` fails with "command not found" or missing modules | `npm install` has not been run in this clone | `npm install`, then `npm test` |
| `npm test` fails mentioning Java, or "Could not start emulator" | Java missing or too old | Install Java 17+ from <https://adoptium.net>. Not the version macOS suggests. |
| `npm test` fails right after you set your completion code | Should no longer happen; test runs stay on the page | If it does, check you did not remove the `!USE_EMULATOR` condition in `experiment.js` |
| Page is blank on the github.io address but fine locally | A path starting with `/`, or Pages not enabled, or repo is private | Section 3; make every path relative |
| Live page shows an old version | Browser cache | Hard-reload; allow two minutes after pushing |
| Google will not let you create a project | Workspace policy on a university account | Use a personal Google account; section 2 |
| Export says it found nothing | `--experiment` does not match `EXPERIMENT.id` | Section 6, step 3 |
| Writes start failing late in data collection | Free daily write limit | Raise `chunk_size`; writes resume the next day |
| A participant emails you a `.json` file | Their connection dropped and the page offered a download | Put it in `data/raw/<id>/manual/`, read it alongside the CSVs, and commit it: it is part of your data. Do not commit their email. |

A note on the config file in a public repo: GitHub will not warn you
about it, and there is nothing to warn about. Secret scanning does not
flag Firebase web configs, and on many repositories it is switched off
entirely. Do not take silence as proof that something *is* a secret or
*is not*; the rule is simply that the config is public by design and the
service-account key from section 6 never goes near the repository.

## What to tell your agent

Agents are good at this stack, but they have habits worth heading off.
The template already tells them all of this in `CLAUDE.md`; repeat it if
you see one drifting:

-   Never loosen `firebase/firestore.rules` to make something work.
-   Never commit a service-account key.
-   Never switch to jsPsych 7 syntax or load libraries from the
    internet.
-   Keep consent first and debrief last.
-   Run `npm test` before every push.

## Glossary

-   **Clone**: make your own local copy of a GitHub repository.
-   **Config object**: the six lines naming the Firebase project your
    page talks to. Public.
-   **Firestore**: the Firebase database your data lands in.
-   **Anonymous sign-in**: giving each participant's browser a random
    id, with no account.
-   **Rules**: the file deciding who may read and write your data.
-   **Production mode / test mode**: starting with everything locked
    (correct) versus everything open and expiring after 30 days (wrong
    for this course).
-   **Service account / private key**: the file letting your export
    script read your data as you.
-   **Long format**: one row per observation, rather than one row per
    participant.
-   **Query parameter**: the `name=value` pairs after a `?` in a URL.
-   **Quarto / Render**: a document format mixing text and R code;
    rendering runs the code and produces a web page.
-   **Emulator**: a local practice copy of the database, used by
    `npm test`.
